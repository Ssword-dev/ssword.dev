# ssword.dev
ssword-dev or ssword.dev is a multipurpose
website built in next.js

## build tools
in ssword.dev, all of the files you see
in the docs/ and its parent subdirectory
are actually what known as `MDX`

the build tool builds the jsx page for a certain mdx
that are in the docs/ directory (check source code)

fun fact! this build tool has a plugin that replaces every
`<Source />` and `<SourceAsMarkdown />` with the source code!

here is the source code for this file btw:
<SourceAsMarkdown />
